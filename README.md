# BTTimerSync
When I working with Pomodoro Technique at home, some time my family doesn't know it, they interrupt when they need. But that make me upset. So I designed a set of devices. Device A is a button to start the timer, Device B is the revicer that show the timer. So I can put the Device B in living room, my family can see if I'm working or not. They communicate via Bluetooth BTW.
